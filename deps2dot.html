<h1><code>deps2dot</code></h1>

<p>This is not strictly related to UML but this script is how all this started, plus it provides a
convenient and terse syntax as compared with raw Graphviz or <code>classes2dot</code>.</p>

<p><code>deps2dot</code> is designed to handle a very narrow class of graphs — dependency graphs.
There are many uses for dependency graphs, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A set of C source and header files, with dependency representing inclusion. It is best to
		start studying with the header file that depends on nothing and proceed to those that depend
		on the files you have already studied, but with more than 7±2 files, the order becomes
		non-obvious. By entering the dependencies and looking at the graph, you can easily choose
		the optimum sequence.</li>
	<li>A set of tasks to be done. However, some tasks require that other tasks be completed before
		they can be started.</li>
	<li>A set of interdependent refactorings. If you do them in dependency order, each refactoring
		becomes a small, reviewable patch in the source control system. If you start with some
		arbitrary refactoring and it turns out that you need another one to make the code compile,
		you now have two options: to undo the changes, do that other refactoring first and then try
		to repeat this one; or to plough right through and plop both refactorings together in one
		patch. If you’re unlucky, that other refactoring will require several more unrelated
		changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The syntax accepted by <code>deps2dot</code> is very simple:</p>

<pre><code>Dependent:
    Dependency_1
    Dependency_2
    :
    Dependency_N</code></pre>

<p>This states that <code>Dependent</code> depends on each <code>Dependency_<var>i</var></code>.
Conversely, dependents can be grouped too:</p>

<pre><code>Dependent_1:
Dependent_2:
:
Dependent_N:
    Dependency</code></pre>

<p>This states that each <code>Dependent_<var>i</var></code> depends on <code>Dependency</code>.
Also, both groupings can be used at the same time:</p>

<pre><code>Dependent_1:
Dependent_2:
    Dependency_1
    Dependency_2</code></pre>

<p>Such syntax states that for each pair (<var>i</var>, <var>j</var>),
<code>Dependent_<var>i</var></code> depends on <code>Dependency_<var>j</var></code>.</p>

<p>Each dependent must begin in the first position of the line and must end with a colon and
newline, and each dependency must be indented from the beginning of line with one or more space or
tab.</p>
